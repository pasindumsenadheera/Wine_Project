## 📖 About

This project is a complete machine learning web application that:
- **Analyzes** chemical properties of wines
- **Predicts** quality ratings (scale 3-8) 
- **Visualizes** data relationships
- **Explains** model decisions

The app uses a Random Forest classifier trained on wine chemical properties to predict quality scores with high accuracy.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The project uses the **WineQT dataset** containing:

**Features (Chemical Properties):**
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

**Target:**
- Quality (score 3-8)

## 🧠 Machine Learning

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Classes**: 6 (quality ratings 3-8)
- **Features**: 11 chemical properties
- **Performance**: ~72% accuracy

### Training Process
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature selection and engineering
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Model evaluation and persistence

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Navigate** through different sections using the sidebar
2. **Explore** data with interactive filters and visualizations
3. **Predict** wine quality by adjusting chemical property sliders
4. **Analyze** model performance and feature importance

### Example Prediction:
- Set alcohol content to 11.5%
- Adjust sulphates to 0.7
- Keep volatile acidity below 0.5
- Get predicted quality score with confidence levels

## 🌐 Deployment
